Convergence of finite element approximations
============================================

In this section we develop tools to prove convergence of finite
element approximations to the exact solutions of PDEs.

Weak derivatives
----------------

Consider a triangulation `\mathcal{T}` with recursively refined
triangulations `\mathcal{T}_h` and corresponding finite element spaces
`V_h`.  Given stable finite element variational problems, we have a
sequence of solutions `u_h` as `h\to 0`, satisfying the
`h`-independent bound

.. math::
      
   \|u_h\|_{H^1(\Omega)} \leq C.

What are these solutions converging to? We need to find a Hilbert
space that contains all `V_h` as `h\to0`, that extends the `H^1` norm
to the `h\to 0` limit of finite element functions.

Our first task is to define a derivative that works for all finite
element functions, without reference to a mesh. This requires some
preliminary definitions, starting by considering some very smooth
functions that vanish on the boundaries together with their
derivatives (so that we can integrate by parts as much as we like).

.. proof:definition:: Compact support on `\Omega`

   A function `u` has compact support on `\Omega` if there exists `\epsilon>0`
   such that `u(x)=0` when `\min_{y\in\partial\Omega}|x-y|<\epsilon`.

.. proof:definition:: `C^\infty_0(\Omega)`
   
   We denote by `C^\infty_0(\Omega)` the subset of `C^\infty(\Omega)`
   corresponding to functions that have \emph{compact support} on
   `\Omega`.

Next we will define a space containing the generalised derivative.

.. proof:definition:: `L^1_{loc}`
		      
   For triangles `K \subset \mathrm{int}\,(\Omega)`, we define

   .. math::

      \|u\|_{L^1(K)} = \int_K |u|\, d x,

   and

   .. math::

      L^1_K = \left\{u:\|u\|_{L^1(K)}<\infty\right\}.

   Then

   .. math::

      L^1_{loc} = \left\{
      f: f \in L^1(K) \quad \forall K\subset\mathrm{int}\,(\Omega)
      \right
      \}.

Finally we are in a position to introduce the generalisation of the
derivative itself.
      
.. proof:definition:: Weak derivative
		      
   The weak derivative `D_w^\alpha f\in L^1_{loc}(\Omega)` of a function `f\in L^1_{loc}(\Omega)` is defined by

   .. math::
   
      \int_\Omega \phi D_w^\alpha f \, d x = (-1)^{|\alpha|}
      \int_\Omega D^\alpha \phi f \, d x, \quad \forall \phi\in C^\infty_0(\Omega).

Not that we do not see any boundary terms since `\phi` vanishes at the
boundary along with all derivatives.
      
Now we check that the derivative agrees with our finite element derivative
definition.

.. proof:lemma::

   Let `V` be a `C^0` finite element space. Then, for `u\in V`, the finite
   element derivative of u is equal to the weak
   derivative of `u`.

.. proof:proof:: 

   Taking any `\phi\in C_0^\infty(\Omega)`, we have

   .. math::

      \int_\Omega
      \phi \frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}|_{FE}u \, d x  = \sum_{K}\int_K \phi \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_i}\, d x,
      
      = \sum_K\left(-\int_K \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x_i} u \, d x + \int_{\partial K}
      \phi n_i u \, d S\right),

      = -\sum_K\int_K \frac{\partial\phi}{\partial x_i} u \, d x = -\int_\Omega
      \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x_i} u \, d x,

   as required.

.. proof:exercise::

   Let `V` be a `C^1` finite element space. For `u\in V`, show that the finite
   second derivatives of u is equal to the weak
   second derivative of `u`.

.. proof:exercise::


   Let `V` be a discontinuous finite element space. For `u\in V`, show
   that the weak derivative does not coincide with the finite element
   derivative in general (find a counter-example).
   
.. proof:lemma:: 

   For `u\in C^{|\alpha|}(\Omega)`, the usual ``strong'' derivative
   `D^\alpha` of u is equal to the weak derivative `D_w^\alpha` of `u`.

.. proof:proof::

   Exercise. [very similar to previous proof]

Due to these equivalences, we do not need to distinguish between
strong, weak and finite element first derivatives for `C^0` finite
element functions. All derivatives are assumed to be weak from now on.


Sobolev spaces
--------------

We are now in a position to define a space that contains all `C^0`
finite element spaces. This means that we can consider the limit
of finite element approximations as `h\to 0`.

.. proof:definition:: The Sobolev space `H^1`

   `H^1(\Omega)` is the function space defined by

   .. math::

      H^1(\Omega) = \left\{
      u\in L^1_{loc}: \|u\|_{H^1(\Omega)}<\infty\right\}.

Going further, the Sobolev space `H^k` is the space of all functions
with finite `H^k` norm.
      
.. proof:definition:: The Sobolev space `H^k`

   `H^k(\Omega)` is the function space defined by
   
   .. math::

      H^k(\Omega) = \left\{
      u\in L^1_{loc}: \|u\|_{H^k(\Omega)}<\infty\right\}

Since `\|u\|_{H^k(\Omega)} \leq \|u\|_{H^l(\Omega)}` for `k<l`,
we have `H^k \subset H^l` for `k<l`.
      
If we are to consider limits of finite element functions in these
Sobolev spaces, then it is important that they are closed, i.e.
limits remain in the spaces.

.. proof:lemma:: `H^k` spaces are Hilbert spaces

   The space `H^k(\Omega)` is closed.

   Let `\{u_i\}` be a Cauchy sequence in `H^k`. Then `\{D^\alpha u_i\}`
   is a Cauchy sequence in `L^2(\Omega)` (which is closed), so `\exists
   v^\alpha \in L^2(\Omega)` such that `D^\alpha u_i\to v^\alpha` for
   `|\alpha|\leq k`.  If `w_j\to w` in `L^2(\Omega)`, then for `\phi\in
   C^\infty_0(\Omega)`,

   .. math::

      \int_\Omega (w_j-w)\phi \, d x \leq \|w_j-w\|_{L^2(\Omega)}\|\phi\|_{L^\infty}\to 0.

   We use this equation to get

   .. math::
      
      \int_\Omega v^\alpha \phi \, d x  = \lim_{i\to \infty} \int_\Omega
      \phi D^\alpha u_i \, d x,
      
      = \lim_{i\to \infty} (-1)^{|\alpha|}\int_\Omega u_i D^\alpha\phi \, d x ,
 
      = (-1)^{|\alpha|} \int_\Omega v D^\alpha \phi \, d x,

   i.e. `v^\alpha` is the weak derivative of `u` as required.

We quote the following much deeper results without proof.

.. proof:theorem:: `H=W`

   Let `\Omega` be any open set. Then `H^k(\Omega)\cap C^\infty(\Omega)`
is dense in `H^k(\Omega)`.

The interpretation is that for any function `u\in H^k(\Omega)`,
we can find a sequence of `C^\infty` functions `u_i` converging
to `u`. This is very useful as we can compute many things using
`C^\infty` functions and take the limit.

.. proof:theorem:: Sobolev's inequality

   Let `\Omega` be an `n`-dimensional domain with Lipschitz boundary, let
   `k` be an integer with `k>n/2`. Then there exists a constant
   `C` such that

   .. math::

      \|u\|_{L^\infty(\Omega)} = \ess\sup_{x\in \Omega}|u(x)|
      \leq C\|u\|_{H^k(\Omega)}.

   Further, there is a `C^0` continuous function in the `L^\infty(\Omega)`
   equivalence class of `u`.

   The interpretation is that if `u\in H^k` then there is a continuous
   function `u_0` such that the set of points where `u\neq u_0` has
   zero area/volume.

.. proof:corollary:: Sobolev's inequality for derivatives

   Let `\Omega` be a `n`-dimensional domain with Lipschitz boundary, let
   `k` be an integer with `k-m>n/2`. Then there exists a constant
   `C` such that

   .. math::

      \|u\|_{W_\infty^m(\Omega)} :=
      \sum_{|\alpha|\leq m}\|D^\alpha u\|_{L^\infty(\Omega)}
      \leq C\|u\|_{H^k(\Omega)}.

   Further, there is a `C^m` continuous function in the `L^\infty(\Omega)`
   equivalence class of `u`.

.. proof:proof::

   Just apply Sobolev's inequality to the `m` derivatives of `u`.


Variational formulations of PDEs
--------------------------------

We can now consider linear variational problems defined on `H^k`
spaces, by taking a bilinear form `b(u,v)` and linear form
`F(v)`, seeking `u\in H^k` (for chosen `H^k`) such that

.. math::

   b(u,v) = F(v), \quad \forall v \in H^k.

Since `H^k` is a Hilbert space, the Lax-Milgram theorem can be used to
analyse, the existence of a unique solution to an `H^k` linear
variational problem.

For example, the Helmholtz problem solveability is immediate.

.. proof:theorem:: Well-posedness for (modified) Helmholtz)

   The Helmholtz variational problem on `H^1` satisfies the conditions
of the Lax-Milgram theorem.

.. proof:proof::

   The proof for `C^0` finite element spaces extends immediately
   to `H^1`.

Next, we develop the relationship between solutions of the Helmholtz
variational problem and the strong-form Helmholtz equation,

.. math::

   u - \nabla^2 u = f, \quad \frac{\partial u}{\partial n} = 0, \mbox{ on } \partial\Omega.

The basic idea is to check that when you take a solution of the
Helmholtz variational problem and integrate by parts (provided that
this makes sense) then you reveal that the solution solves the strong
form equation. Functions in `H^k` make boundary values hard to
interpret since they are not guaranteed to have defined values on the
boundary.  We make the following definition.

.. proof:definition:: Trace of `H^1` functions

   Let `u\in H^1(\Omega)` and choose `u_i\in C^\infty(\Omega)` such
   that `u_i\to u`. We define the \emph{trace} `u|_{\partial\Omega}`
   on `\partial\Omega` as the limit of the restriction of `u_i` to
   `\partial\Omega`. This definition is unique from the uniqueness of
   limits.

We can extend our trace inequality for finite element functions directly
to `H^1` functions.

.. proof:lemma:: Trace theorem for `H^1` functions
		 
   Let `u \in H^1(\Omega)` for a polygonal domain `\Omega`. Then the
   trace `u|_{\partial\Omega}` satisfies 

   .. math::

      \|
      u\|_{L^2(\partial\Omega)} \leq C\|u\|_{H^1(\Omega)}.  

The interpretation of this result is that if `u\in H^1(\Omega)` then
`u|_{\partial\Omega}\in L^2(\partial\Omega)`.
      
.. proof:proof::
   
   Adapt the proof for `C^0` finite element functions, choosing `u\in
   C^\infty(\Omega)`, and pass to the limit in `H^1(\Omega)`. 

This tells us when the integration by parts formula makes sense.
   
.. proof:lemma::
   
   Let `u\in H^2(\Omega)`, `v\in H^1(\Omega)`. Then

   .. math::
      \int_\Omega (-\nabla^2 u)v \, d x
      = \int_\Omega \nabla u\cdot\nabla v \, d x - \int_{\partial \Omega}
      \frac{\partial u}{\partial n} v\, d S.

.. proof:proof::

   First note that `u\in H^2(\Omega)\implies \nabla u \in (H^1(\Omega))^d`.
   Then

   .. math

      \| v\nabla u\|_{H^1(\Omega)} \leq  \|v\|_{H^1(\Omega)}\|\nabla u\|_{H^1(\Omega)}
      \implies v\nabla u \in H^1(\Omega).

   Then, take `v_i\in C^\infty(\Omega)` and `u_i\in C^\infty(\Omega)` converging
   to `v` and `u`, respectively, and `v_i\nabla u_i\in C^\infty(\Omega)` converges
   to `v\nabla u`. These satisfy the equation;
   we obtain the result by passing to the limit.

Now we have everything we need to show that solutions of the strong
form equation also solve the variational problem. It is just a matter
of substituting into the formula and applying integration by parts.
   
.. proof:lemma::

   For `f\in L^2`,
   let `u\in H^2(\Omega)` solve

   .. math::
      
      u - \nabla^2 u = f, \quad \frac{\partial u}{\partial n} = 0 \mbox{ on } \partial\Omega,

   in the `L^2` sense, i.e. `\|u-\nabla^2 u - f\|_{L^2}=0`. Then
   `u` solves the variational form of the Helmholtz equation.

.. proof::
   
   `u\in H^2\implies \|u\|_{H^2}<\infty\implies \|u\|_{H^1}<\infty\implies
   u\in H^1`. Multiplying by test function `v\in H^1`, and using the
   previous proposition gives

   .. math::
      
      \int_\Omega uv + \nabla u\cdot\nabla v\, d x = \int_\Omega fv \, d x, 
      \quad \forall v \in H^1(\Omega),

   as required.

Now we go the other way, showing that solutions of the variational
problem also solve the strong form equation. To do this, we need to
assume a bit more smoothness of the solution, that it is in `H^2`
instead of just `H^1`.
   
.. proof:theorem::
   
   Let `f\in L^2(\Omega)` and suppose that `u\in H^2(\Omega)` solves the
   variational Helmholtz equation on a polygonal domain `\Omega`. Then
   `u` solves the strong form Helmholtz equation with zero Neumann
   boundary conditions.

.. proof:proof::

   Using integration by parts for `u\in H^2`, `v\in C^\infty_0(\Omega)\in
   H^1`, we have

   .. math::
   
      \int_\Omega (u-\nabla^2 u -f)v\, d x = \int_\Omega uv + \nabla u\cdot\nabla
      v - vf \, d x = 0.

   It is a standard result that `C^\infty_0(\Omega)` is dense in `L^2(\Omega)`
   (i.e., every `L^2` function can be approximated arbitrarily closely by
   a `C^\infty_0` function),
   and therefore we can choose a sequence of v converging to `u-\nabla^2 u - f`
   and we obtain `\|u-\nabla^2 u -f \|_{L^2(\Omega)}=0`.

   Now we focus on showing the boundary condition is satisfied.
   We have

   .. math::
      0 = \int_\Omega uv + \nabla u \cdot \nabla v - fv \, d x
      = \int_\Omega uv + \nabla u \cdot \nabla v - (u-\nabla^2u)v \, d x

      = \int_{\partial\Omega} \frac{\partial u}{\partial n}v\, d S.

   We can find arbitrary `v\in L_2(\partial\Omega)`, hence
   `\|\frac{\partial u}{\partial n}\|_{L^2(\partial\Omega)}=0`.

Galerkin approximations of linear variational problems
------------------------------------------------------

Going a bit more general again, assume that we have a well-posed
linear variational problem on `H^k`, connected to a strong form
PDE. Now we would like to approximate it. This is done in general
using the Galerkin approximation.
   
.. proof:definition:: Galerkin approximation

   Consider a linear variational problem of the form:

   find `u \in H^k` such that

   .. math::

      b(u,v) = F(v), \quad \forall v \in H^k.
		      
   For a finite element space `V_h\subset V=H^k(\Omega)`, the Galerkin
   approximation of this `H^k` variational problem
   seeks to find `u_h\in V_h` such that

   .. math::

      b(u_h,v) = F(v), \quad \forall v \in V_h.

We just restrict the trial function `u` and the test function `v` to
the finite element space. `C^0` finite element spaces are subspaces of
`H^1`, `C^1` finite element spaces are subspaces of `H^2` and so on.

If `b(u,v)` is continuous and coercive on `H^k`, then it is also
continuous and coercive on `V_h` by the subspace property. Hence,
we know that the Galerkin approximation exists, is unique and is
stable. This means that it will be possible to solve the matrix-vector
equation.

Moving on, if we can solve the equation, we would like to know if it is
useful. What is the size of the error `u-u_h`? For Galerkin approximations
this question is addressed by Céa's lemma.

.. proof:theorem:: Céa's lemma.
   
   Let `V_h\subset V`, and let `u` solve a linear variational problem
   on `V`, whilst `u_h` solves the equivalent Galerkin approximation
   on `V_h`. Then

   .. math::
      \|u-u_h\|_V \leq \frac{M}{\gamma}\min_{v\in V_h}
      \|u-v\|_V,

   where `M` and `\gamma` are the continuity and coercivity constants
   of `b(u,v)`, respectively.

.. proof:proof::

   We have

   .. math::
   
      b(u,v) = F(v) \quad \forall v \in V, 
      b(u_h,v)  = F(v) \quad \forall v \in V_h.

   Choosing `v\in V_h\subset V` means we can use it in both equations,
   and subtraction and linearity lead to the ``Galerkin orthogonality''
   condition

   .. math::
   
      b(u-u_h,v) = 0, \quad \forall v\in V_h.

   Then, for all `v\in V_h`,

   .. math::
      
      \gamma\|u-u_h\|^2_V \leq b(u-u_h,u-u_h),
   
      = b(u-u_h,u-v) + \underbrace{b(u-u_h,v-u_h)}_{=0},

      \leq M\|u-u_h\|_V\|u-v\|_V.

   So,

   .. math::

      \gamma\|u-u_h\|_V \leq M|u-v\|_V.
      
   Minimising over all `v` completes the proof.

The interpretation of Céa's lemma is that the error is proportional
to the minimal error in approximating `u` in `V_h`.
We can estimate the error in approximating `u` in `V_h`
if `u\in C^2(\Omega)`, using Taylor series.
However, if `u\in H^2(\Omega)`, then `u` does not necessarily
have a degree 2 Taylor polynomial, since derivatives are not defined
at arbitrary points. We need a more general error formula, which
we will treat next.
