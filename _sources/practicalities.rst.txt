Practical matters
=================

Lecturers
---------

The module is led by `Dr Colin Cotter
<http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/colin.cotter>`_ and `Dr David Ham
<http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/david.ham>`_.

Accreditation
-------------

This module is an accredited elective for third and fourth year
mathematics and JMC undergraduates, and for the `MSc
in Applied Mathematics
<http://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/courses/mathematics/applied-mathematics/>`_.
Other Imperial students wishing to take the module should contact the
lecturers in the first instance.

Assumed knowledge
-----------------

The theory component of the module will assume only a familiarity with
PDEs, vector calculus and basic undergraduate analysis. The
implementation part of the module additionally assumes some ability to
program in a high level language (for example Python, Matlab, Java, C
or C++). The implementation will be in Python, a very high level and
simple language with similarities to Matlab. Students who are not
familiar with Python will need to acquire some familiarity with the
language, for example by doing one of the suggested tutorials.

Assessment
----------

The theory part of the module will be assessed by an exam worth 50% of
the module. The implementation part of the module will be assessed by
submission of your working code implementing finite element in two
dimensions. This will also be worth 50%

Submitting code for feedback
............................

The assessment of your finite element implementation will occur in a
single submission at the end of term. However feedback on your
progress will be available during the term. Informal feedback will be
available during the labs, and you will have the opportunity to submit
your code for formal feedback twice during the term, in weeks 4 and 7.

Mastery
.......

All Department of Mathematics fourth year and masters courses must
contain a mastery component. This part of the course is only for
completion by those students: third year students are exempt.

The mastery component of this module will be the extension exercise to
the implementation project and an additional question on the
exam. This maintains the overall balance in the assessment between
coursework and exam.

Blackboard
----------

Important announcements and the coursework submission will be conducted
via Blackboard. Please ensure you are enrolled in this module on Blackboard!
