Interpolation operators
=======================

In this section we investigate how continuous functions can be
approximated by finite element functions. We start locally,
looking at a single finite element, and then move globally to
function spaces on a triangulation.

Local and global interpolation operators
----------------------------------------

.. proof:definition:: Local interpolant

   Given a finite element `(K,\mathcal{P},\mathcal{N})`, with
   corresponding nodal basis `\{\phi_i\}_{i=0}^k`. Let `v`
   be a function such that `N_i(v)` is well-defined for all `i`.
   Then the local interpolant `\mathcal{I}_K` is an operator
   mapping `v` to `\mathcal{P}` such that

   .. math::
      
      (I_Kv)(x) = \sum_{i=0}^kN_i(v)\phi_i(x).

We now discuss some useful properties of the local interpolant.
      
.. _Ilinear:

.. proof:lemma:: 
  
   The operator `I_K` is linear.

.. proof:proof::
   Exercise.

.. _I_same_nodes:
   
.. proof:lemma::

   .. math::
      
      N_i(I_K(v)) = N_i(v), \, \forall\,  0\leq i\leq k.

.. proof:proof::
   Exercise.

.. _I_projection

.. proof:lemma::
      
   `I_K` is the identity when restricted to `\mathcal{P}`.

.. proof:proof::
   Exercise.

By combining together the local interpolants in each triangle of the
triangulation, we obtain the global interpolant into the finite
element space.
   
.. proof:definition:: Global interpolant

   Let `V_h` be a finite element space constructed from a triangulation
   `\mathcal{T}_h` with finite elements
   `(K_i,\mathcal{P}_i,\mathcal{N}_i)`, each with a `C^m` geometric
   decomposition. The global interpolant `\mathcal{I}_h` is defined by
   `\mathcal{I}_hu \in V_h` such that
   
   .. math::

      \mathcal{I}_hu|_K = I_Ku

   for each `K \in \mathcal{T}_h`.

Measuring interpolation errors
------------------------------
   
Next we look at how well we can approximate continuous functions using
the interpolation operator, i.e. we want to measure the approximation
error `\mathcal{I}_h u - u`. We are interested in integral
formulations, so we want to use integral quantities to measure errors.
We have already seen the `L^2` norm. It is also useful to take
derivatives into account when measuring the error. To discuss higher
order derivatives, we introduce the multi-index.

.. proof:definition:: Multi-index.

   For `d`-dimensional space, a multi-index `\alpha=(\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_d)`
   assigns the number of partial derivatives in each Cartesian direction.
   We write `|\alpha|=\sum_{i=1}^d\alpha_i`.

This means we can write mixed partial derivatives, for example if
`\alpha=(1,2)` then

.. math::

   D^\alpha u = \frac{\partial^3 u}{\partial x\partial y^2}.

Now we can define some norms involving derivatives for measuring
errors.

.. proof:definition:: `H^k` seminorm and norm

   The `H^k` seminorm is defined as

   .. math::

      |u|_{H^k}^2 = \sum_{|\alpha|=k}\int_\Omega |D^\alpha u|^2 \, dx,

   where the sum is taken over all multi-indices of size `k` i.e. all the
   derivatives are of degree `k`.
   
   The `H^k` norm is defined as

   .. math::

      \|u\|_{H^k}^2 = \sum_{i=0}^k |u|_{H^i}^2.

   where we conventionally write `|u|_{H^0}=\|u\|_{L^2}`.

To help to estimate interpolation errors, we quote the following
important result (which we will return to much later).

.. proof:theorem:: Sobolev's inequality (for continuous functions)

   Let `\Omega` be an `n`-dimensional domain with Lipschitz boundary,
   and let `u` be a continuous function.
   Let
   `k` be an integer with `k>n/2`. Then there exists a constant
   `C` (depending only on `\Omega`) such that

   .. math::

      \|u\|_{C^\infty(\Omega)} = \max_{x \in \Omega}|u(x)|
      \leq C\|u\|_{H^k(\Omega)}.

.. proof:proof::

   See a functional analysis course or textbook.

This is extremely useful because it means that we can measure the
`H^k` norm by integrating and know that it gives an upper bound on the
value of `u` at each point. We say that `u` is in `C^\infty(\Omega)`
if `\|u\|_{C^\infty(\Omega)}<\infty`, and Sobolev's inequality tells
us that this is the case if `\|u\|_{H^k(\Omega)}<\infty` 

This result can be easily extended to
derivatives.

.. proof:corollary:: Sobolev's inequality for derivatives (for continuous functions)

   Let `\Omega` be a `n`-dimensional domain with Lipschitz boundary,
   and let `u` be a continuous function with continuous derivatives
   up to degree `m`.
   Let
   `k` be an integer with `k-m>n/2`. Then there exists a constant
   `C` (depending only on `\Omega`) such that

   .. math::

      \|u\|_{C^{m,\infty}(\Omega)} :=
      \sum_{|\alpha|\leq m}\max_{x \in \Omega}|D^\alpha u(x)|
      \leq C\|u\|_{H^k(\Omega)}.

.. proof:proof::

   Just apply Sobolev's inequality to the `m` derivatives of `u`.

Approximation by averaged Taylor polynomials
--------------------------------------------
   
The basic tool for analysing interpolation error for continuous
functions is the Taylor series. Rather than taking the Taylor series
about a single point, since we are interested in integral quantities,
it makes sense to consider an averaged Taylor series over some region
inside each cell. This will become important later when we start
thinking about more general types of derivative that only exist in an
integral sense.
   
.. proof:definition:: Averaged Taylor polynomial

   Let `\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^n` be a domain with diameter `d`, that
   is star-shaped with respect to a ball `B` with radius `\epsilon`,
   contained within `\Omega`. For `f\in H^{k+1}(\Omega)` the
   averaged Taylor polynomial `Q_{k,B}f\in \mathcal{P}_k` is defined
   as

   .. math::
      
      Q_{k,B} f(x) = \frac{1}{|B|}\int_{B} T^kf(y,x) \, d y,

   where `T^kf` is the Taylor polynomial of degree `k` of `f`,

   .. math::
      T^k f(y,x) =
      \sum_{|\alpha|\leq k} D^\alpha f(y)\frac{(x-y)^\alpha}{\alpha!},

Now we develop an estimate of the error `T^kf - f`.

.. _taylorerror:

.. proof:theorem::
   
   Let `\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^n` be a domain with diameter `d`, that
   is star-shaped with respect to a ball `B` with radius `\epsilon`,
   contained within `\Omega`. Let `k` be an integer with `k-m < n/2`.
   Then there exists a constant `C(k,n)` such that
   for `0\leq |\beta| \leq k+1` and all `f \in C^{m,\infty}(\Omega)`,

   .. math::
      
      \|D^\beta(f-Q_{k,B}f)\|_{L^2} \leq C\frac{|\Omega|^{1/2}}{|B|^{1/2}}
      d^{k+1-|\beta|}\|\nabla^{k+1}f\|_{L^2(\Omega)}.

.. proof:proof::

   The Taylor remainder theorem (see a calculus textbook) gives

   .. math::
      
      f(x) - T_kf(y,x) = 
      (k+1)\sum_{|\alpha|=k+1}\frac{(x-y)^\alpha}{\alpha!}
      \int_0^1 D^\alpha f(ty + (1-t)x)t^k\, d t,

   where

   .. math::

      \alpha! = \prod_{i=1}^n \alpha_i!,

   when `f \in C^{m,\infty}` for `m>k`.

   Integration over `y` in `B` and dividing by `|B|` gives

   .. math::
      
      f(x) - Q_{k,B}f(x) = \frac{k+1}{|B|}\sum_{|\alpha|=k+1}
      \int_B\frac{(x-y)^\alpha}{\alpha!}\times 
      \int_0^1 D^\alpha f(ty + (1-t)x)t^k\, d t \, d y.

   Then

   .. math::
      
      \int_\Omega |f(x)-Q_{k,B}f(x)|^2\, d x
      &\leq C\frac{d^{2(k+1)}}{|B|^2}
      \sum_{|\alpha|=k+1}\int_\Omega
      \left(
      \int_B\int_0^1 |D^\alpha f(ty+(1-t)x)|t^k \, d t\, d y\right)^2\, d x,
      
      &\leq C_0\frac{d^{2(k+1)}}{|B|^2}
      \sum_{|\alpha|=k+1}\int_\Omega
      \int_B\int_0^1 |D^\alpha f(ty+(1-t)x)|^2 \, d t\, d y 
      \int_B\int_0^1 t^{2k}\, d t\, d y\,\, d x.

   Then

   .. math::
   
      \int_\Omega |f(x)-Q_{k,B}f(x)|^2\, d x 
      \leq C_1\frac{d^{2(k+1)}}{|B|^2}
      \sum_{|\alpha|=k+1}\int_\Omega
      \int_B\int_0^1 |D^\alpha f(ty+(1-t)x)|^2 \, d t\, d y \, d x.

   We will get the result by changing variables and exchanging
   the `t`, `y` and `x` integrals. To avoid a singularity when
   `t=0` or `t=1`,
   for each `\alpha` term we can split the `t` integral
   into `[0,1/2]` and `[1/2,1]`. Call these terms I and II.

   Denote by `g_\alpha` the extension by zero of `D^\alpha f` to
   `\mathbb{R}^n`. Then

   .. math::
      
      I &=  \int_B \int_0^{1/2} \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} |g_\alpha(ty+(1-t)x)|^2
      \, d x \, d t\, d y,
      
      &=  \int_B \int_0^{1/2} \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} |g_\alpha((1-t)x)|^2\, d x \, d t
      \, d y,
      
      &=  \int_B \int_0^{1/2} \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} |g_\alpha(z)|^2
      (1-t)^{-n}
      \, d z \, d t
      \, d y,
   
      &\leq  2^{n-1}|B|\int_\Omega |D^\alpha f(z)|^2\, d z.

   Similarly, for `II`,

   .. math::
      
      II &=  \int_B \int_{1/2}^1 \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} |g_\alpha(ty+(1-t)x)|^2
      \, d x \, d t\, d y,
      
      &=  \int_B \int_{1/2}^1 \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} |g_\alpha(ty)|^2\, d x \, d t
      \, d y, 

      &=  \int_B \int_{1/2}^1 \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} |g_\alpha(z)|^2
      t^{-n}
      \, d z \, d t
      \, d y,
      
      &\leq  2^{n-1}|B|\int_\Omega |D^\alpha f(z)|^2\, d z.


   Hence, we obtain the required bounds for `|\beta|=0`. For higher
   derivatives we use the fact that

   .. math::

      D^\beta Q_{k,B} f(x) = Q_{k-|\beta|,B}D^\beta f(x),

   which immediately leads to the estimate for `|\beta|>0`.

Now we develop this into an estimate that depends on the diameter
of the triangle we are interpolating to.

.. _unittaylorerr:

.. proof:corollary::

   Let `K_1` be a triangle with diameter `1`.
   There exists a constant `C(k,n)` such that

   .. math::
      
      \|f-Q_{k,B}f\|_{H^k(K_1)} \leq C|\nabla^{k+1}f|_{H^{k+1}(K_1)}.

.. proof:proof::

   Take the maximum over the constants for the derivative contributions
   of the left-hand side with `d=1` and use the previous result.

Local and global interpolation errors
-------------------------------------
   
Now we will use the Taylor polynomial estimates to
derive error estimates for the local interpolation operator.
We start by looking at a triangle with diameter 1, and then use
a scaling argument to obtain error estimates in terms of the diameter
`h`. It begins by getting the following bound.

.. _Ibound:

.. proof:lemma::

   Let `(K_1,\mathcal{P},\mathcal{N})` be a finite element such that
   `K_1` is a triangle with diameter 1, and such that the nodal
   variables in `\mathcal{N}` involve only evaluations of functions or
   evaluations of derivatives of degree `\leq l`, and
   `\|N_i\|_{C^{l,\infty}(K_1)'} <\infty`, 

   .. math::

      \|N_i\|_{C^{l,\infty}(K_1)'} = \sup_{\|u\|_{C^{l,\infty}(K_1)}>0}
      \frac{|N_i(u)|}{\|u\|_{W_\infty^l(K_1)}} \qquad \qquad
      (\mbox{Dual norm of }N_i)

   Let `u\in C^{l,\infty}(\Omega)` with `m\geq m`, and let `k-l > n/2`.
   Then

   .. math::

      \|\mathcal{I}_{K_1}u\|_{H^k(K_1)} \leq C\|u\|_{H^k(K_1)}.

.. proof:proof::
   
   Let `\{\phi_i\}_{i=1}^n` be the nodal basis for `\mathcal{P}`. Then
   
   .. math::
      
      \| \mathcal{I}_{K_1}u\|_{H^k(K_1)} &\leq \sum_{i=1}^k \|\phi_i\|_{H^k(K_1)}|N_i(u)|
      
      &\leq \underbrace{\sum_{i=1}^k \|\phi_i\|_{H^k(K_1)}\|N_i\|_{C^{l,\infty}(K_1)'}}_{C_0}\|u\|_{C^{l,\infty}(K_1)},
      
      &\leq C \|u\|_{H^k(K_1)},

   where the Sobolev inequality was used in the last line.

Now we can directly apply this to the interpolation operator error
estimate on the triangle with diameter 1. It is the standard trick of
adding and subtracting something, in this case the Taylor polynomial.

.. _IerrK1:

.. proof:lemma::
   
   Let `(K_1,\mathcal{P},\mathcal{N})` be a finite element such that
   `K_1` has diameter `1`, and such that the nodal variables in
   `\mathcal{N}` involve only evaluations of functions or evaluations
   of derivatives of degree `\leq l`, and `\mathcal{P}` contain all
   polynomials of degree `k` and below, with `k>l+n/2`. Let `u\in
   C^{m,\infty}(K_1)`, with `k+1-m>n/2`. Then for `i \leq k`, the
   local interpolation operator satisfies

   .. math::

      |\mathcal{I}_{K_1}u-u|_{H^i(K_1)} \leq C_1|u|_{H^{k+1}(K_1)}.

.. proof:proof::

   .. math::

      |\mathcal{I}_{K_1}u-u|_{H^i(K_1)}^2 &\leq \|\mathcal{I}_{K_1}u-u\|_{H^k(K_1)}^2
      
      &=
      \|\mathcal{I}_{K_1}u-Q_{k,B}u + Q_{k,B}u - u\|_{H^k(K_1)}^2
      
      &\leq \|Q_{k,B}u-u\|_{H^k(K_1)}^2 + \|\mathcal{I}(u-Q_{k,B}u)\|_{H^k(K_1)}^2,
 
      &\leq \|Q_{k,B}u-u\|_{H^k(K_1)}^2 + C^2\|Q_{k,B}u-u\|_{H^k(K_1)}^2,
      
      &\leq (1+C^2)|u|_{H^{k+1}(K_1)}^2,

   where we used the fact that `I_{K_1}Q_{k,B}u = Q_{k,B}u` in the
   second line and the previous lemma in the third line.

Now we apply a scaling argument to translate this to triangles
with diameter `h`.

.. _scaling:

.. proof:lemma:: 

   Let `(K,\mathcal{P},\mathcal{N})` be a finite element such that
   `K` has diameter `d`, and such that the nodal variables in
   `\mathcal{N}` involve only evaluations of functions or evaluations of
   derivatives of degree `\leq l`, and `\mathcal{P}` contains all
   polynomials of degree `k` and below, with `k>l+n/2`.
   Let `u\in
   C^{m,\infty}(K_1)`, with `k+1-m>n/2`.
   Then for `i \leq k`, the local interpolation operator
   satisfies

   .. math::

      |\mathcal{I}_{K}u-u|_{H^i(K)} \leq C_Kd^{k+1-i}|u|_{H^{k+1}(K)}.

   where `C_K` is a constant that depends on the shape of `K` but not
   the diameter.

.. proof:proof::
   
   Consider the change of variables `x \to \phi(x)=x/d`. This map takes
   `K` to `K_1` with diameter 1. Then

   .. math::

      \int_K |D^\beta(I_Ku-u)|^2 \, d x  &= d^{-2|\beta|+1}\int_{K_1}|D^\beta(I_{K_1}
      u\circ \phi - u\circ \phi)|^2 \, d x,
      
      &\leq C_1^2d^{-2|\beta+1}\sum_{|\alpha|=k+1}\int_{K_1} |D^\alpha u\circ \phi|^2\, d x, 

      &\leq C_1^2d^{-2|\beta+2(k+1)}\sum_{|\alpha|=k+1}\int_{K} |D^\alpha u|^2
      \, d x,
      
      &= C_1^2d^{2(-|\beta| + k + 1)}|u|^2_{H^{k+1}(K)},

   and taking the square root gives the result.

So far we have just developed an error estimate for the local
interpolant on a single triangle. Now we extend this to finite element
spaces defined on the whole triangulation.

.. _Iherr:

.. proof:theorem::

   Let `\mathcal{T}` be a triangulation with finite elements
   `(K_i,\mathcal{P}_i,\mathcal{N}_i)`, such that the minimum aspect
   ratio `r` of the triangles `K_i` satisfies `r>0`, and such that the
   nodal variables in `\mathcal{N}` involve only evaluations of
   functions or evaluations of derivatives of degree `\leq l`, and
   `\mathcal{P}` contains all polynomials of degree `k` and below,
   with `k>l+n/2`.  Let `u\in C^{m,\infty}(K_1)`, with `k+1-m>n/2`.
   Let `h` be the maximum over all of the
   triangle diameters, with `0\leq h<1`. Let `V` be the corresponding
   `C^r` finite element space.  Then for `i\leq k` and `i \leq r+1`, the
   global interpolation operator satisfies

   .. math::

      \|\mathcal{I}_{h}u-u\|_{H^i(\Omega)} \leq Ch^{k+1-i}|u|_{H^{k+1}(\Omega)}.

.. proof:proof::
   
   If `V` is a `C^r` finite element space, then `\mathcal{I}_hu` satisfies
   the conditions of the previous result. 
   
   Then we may write

   .. math::
      
      \|\mathcal{I}_{h}u-u\|_{H^i(\Omega)}^2 &=
      \sum_{K\in\mathcal{T}}\|\mathcal{I}_{K}u-u\|_{H^i(K)}^2,
      
      &\leq \sum_{K\in\mathcal{T}}C_Kd_K^{2(k+1-i)}|u|_{H^{k+1}(K)}^2,
      
      &\leq C_{\max}h^{2(k+1-i)}\sum_{K\in\mathcal{T}}|u|_{H^{k+1}(K)}^2,
      
      &= C_{\max}h^{2(k+1-i)}|u|_{H^{k+1}(\Omega)}^2,

   where the existence of the `C_{\max}=\max_KC_K<\infty` is due to the
   lower bound in the aspect ratio.
   
In this section, we have built a theoretical toolbox for the
interpolation of functions to finite element spaces. In the
next section, we move on to studying the solveability of finite
element approximations.
