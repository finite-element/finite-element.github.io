   This is the webpage for the `Imperial College London Mathematics
   <http://www.imperial.ac.uk/maths>`_  module
   MATH96063/MATH97017/MATH97095 Finite Elements: numerical analysis and
   implementation. Other people are welcome to make use of the
   material here. The authors welcome feedback and would particularly
   appreciate an `email <mailto:david.ham@imperial.ac.uk>`_ if this
   material is used to teach anywhere.

   Part 1: Numerical analysis
   --------------------------

   The theory part of the module will consist of two hours per week
   primarily composed of lectures, with occasional tutorials. This part of
   the module will be led by `Prof. Colin Cotter
   <http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/colin.cotter>`_.

   The text for this part of the module is Brenner and Scott *The
   Mathematical Theory of Finite Element Methods*. Imperial College has
   fortunately paid for PDF access to this book, so it is accessible from
   the Imperial College network at `Springer Link
   <http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-0-387-75934-0>`_.

   Past exam papers
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Please note that for 2015-2018, there was no mastery component in the
   examination, and so there were four questions. From 2019 on there are
   four questions plus one mastery question for 4th year/Masters credits.

   Part 2: Implementation
   ----------------------

   The implementation part of the module aims to give the students a
   deeper understanding of the finite element method through writing
   software to solve finite element problems in one and two dimensions.

   This part of the module will be taught by `Dr David Ham
   <http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/david.ham>`_ in two hours per
   week of computer laboratory time. A PDF version of the
   implementation exercise notes is `available here
   <Finiteelementcourse.pdf>`_.
